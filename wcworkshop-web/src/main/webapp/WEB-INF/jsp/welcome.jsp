  <h1>Welcome to the WC-Workshop!</h1>
  <p>The WC-Workshop will be a web application that enables you to edit all known parts of Wing Commander I and Wing Commander II.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, not all bits of the resource files are known yet.</p>
  <p>
    To speed up finding out the missing parts, this will be the place where you can browse all known information alongside
    the unknown parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most importantly, we need to find out the contents of the three main resource files:
    <ul>
      <li>CAMP.000</li>
      <li>BRIEFING.000</li>
      <li>MODULE.000</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>BRIEFING.000</h3>
    This file holds all conversations, not only briefings (ie bar conversations, medal ceremonies, funerals and conversations in Halcyon's office).<br/>
    What is not fully known so far, is, how conversations are controlled.<br/>
    If you want to help out, please check the conversations in the tree to the left ([C]).<br/>
    Start the game, watch the cutscenes and try to make sense of the commands listet here.<br/>
    If you find out something new, please tell us at the corresponding CIC thread on <a href="http://www.wcnews.com/chatzone/threads/wc-workshop-online.27177/">www.wcnews.com</a>.  
   <h3>CAMP.000</h3>
    CAMP.000 is nearly 100% known already.
   <h3>MODULE.000</h3>
     This is the least-known resource file so far. It is also the most complex one, as it holds all mission data like nav points, etc.<br/>
     We will try to present the already known parts alongside the unknown bytes here as soon as possible.
   <h3>Savegames</h3>
     We have also been able to find out the most important offsets of the savegames.<br/>
     So there should be an integrated savegame editor/generator available soon, which allows you to jump right into the mission you're currently investigating.
   
   <h2>Credits</h2>
   Nothing of this would have been possible without the ongoing efforts of the wingnuts over at the <a href="http://www.wcnews.com">Wing Commander CIC</a>,<br/>
   who did neither stop loving the games nor did they stop supporting the games or spreading news about them.
   <br/><i>Here's to you, Wingnuts!</i>
